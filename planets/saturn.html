<p><font size="6">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter.<hr>
CSaturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.[39] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3, because of the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass,[40] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System. This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth.<hr>
The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.[42] The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.</font></p>
