            <p>
                The culture of Thailand is a unique blend of various influences that have evolved over time. Local customs, animist beliefs, Buddhist traditions, and regional ethnic and cultural practices have all played a role in shaping Thai culture.
              National pride is very much part of the Thai psyche. The country clings to pride that it’s the only nation in Southeast Asia to have never been colonised by European countries. 
              The national anthem is played twice a day, with the expectation that people will stop and stand until the song has finished.
